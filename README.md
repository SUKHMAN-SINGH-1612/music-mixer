### 4. Functionality

#### 4.1. Authentication

* Firebase OAuth Integration
    * Allow users to sign up/sign in via Google, Facebook, etc.
    * Securely store user credentials and session data.


#### 4.2. Room Creation

* Generate unique alphanumeric codes for each room.
* Store room metadata (name, creator, etc.)


#### 4.3. Room Joining

* Validate room codes against the database.
* Add users to the room's active users list.


#### 4.4. Song Search

* Connect to music streaming APIs (Spotify, YouTube, etc.).
* Display search results with relevant song details.


#### 4.5. Playlist Management

* Store playlist data in a structured format (array, linked list)
* Implement add/remove song functionality


#### 4.6. Real-time Updates

* Socket.IO for live bidirectional communication
* Broadcast playlist changes, chat messages, and user joins/leaves.


#### 4.7. Live Chat

* Basic text-based chat interface.
* User name/profile picture associated with each message.


### 5. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React/Vue.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express/ Python with Flask or Django
- **Database:** MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Firebase OAuth
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- **Music API:** Spotify API/YouTube API


### 6. Project Milestones

1. **Authentication and Basic UI Setup:** (1 day)
    * Implement Firebase OAuth.
    * Set up the basic layout of the application.
2. **Room Creation and Joining:** (1-2 days)
    * Implement room creation with unique codes.
    * Implement room joining functionality.
3. **Song Search and Playlist Management:** (2-3 days)
    * Integrate with a music streaming API.
    * Implement song search and playlist management.
4. **Real-time Collaboration:** (1-2 days)
    * Implement real-time updates for playlist changes.
5. **Live Chat:** (1 day)
    * Implement a live chat feature within the room.
6. **Testing and Debugging:** (1 day)
    * Test the application thoroughly and fix any bugs.

### 7. Project Risks

- **API Rate Limits:** Music streaming APIs often have rate limits, which could affect the song search functionality. Implement caching and error handling to mitigate this risk.
- **Real-time Update Complexity:** Implementing real-time updates using WebSockets can be complex and require careful management of connections.
- **Scalability Issues:** As the number of users and rooms grows, the application may face scalability challenges. Consider using a load balancer and optimizing the database schema.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Ensure secure authentication and prevent unauthorized access to user data by implementing proper security measures.
